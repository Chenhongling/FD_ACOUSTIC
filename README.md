# Finite-Difference seismic wave simulation
This is a collection of scripts to simulate seismic wave propagation in 1-D and 2-D.
The wave propagation is based on the acoustic wave equation, which is solved by Finite-Differences. 

The scripts will be written mainly in C and MATLAB.
Further versions will be parallelized by OpenMPI.
